# SIMPLE RECURSION CODE AND DEFINE RECURSION
# def sum(a):
#     if a==1:
#         return 1
#     return a+sum(a-1)
# print(sum(5))
# IT IS A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF CONTINIOUSLY, WE CAN ALSO GIVE LIMIT TILL WHERE IT WILL RUN
# WHAT IF SOMEONE ASK YOU WHAT IS THE LIMIT OF RECURSION IF WE DIDN'T GIVE ANY LIMIT TILL WHERE 
# IT WILL RUN , SO THE ANSWER IS THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHICH DEVUCE YOU ARE RUNNING IT BUT THERIOCALLY IT WILL CALL ITSELF 1000 TIMES
